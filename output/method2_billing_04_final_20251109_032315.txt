Okay, let me start by reviewing the draft report against the research summary to ensure factual accuracy. The research summary mentions 5 Reddit posts with specific complaints about unexpected charges, billing setup confusion, and promotional issues. The draft correctly references these points, including the exact charges like "$15 SC 6GB data SMHS" and "$11 One time charge Telesales / Weborder charge." It also notes the lack of Play Store results, which aligns with the summary.

Next, checking structural compliance with the outline. The draft follows the provided outline exactly, with sections 1 through 7 as specified. Each subsection under Problem Analysis and Platform-Specific Insights is present and properly labeled. The recommendations are categorized with clear actions and rationales, and implementation priority is addressed. The conclusion wraps up the key points effectively.

For clarity and professionalism, the language is formal and well-structured. Each section flows logically, and technical terms are appropriately used. The recommendations are specific, such as the "Fee Transparency Portal" and "Plan Comparison Tool," which are actionable. The draft avoids markdown and maintains a professional tone throughout.

Attribution of sources is accurate. All complaints are correctly attributed to Reddit, and the absence of Play Store data is clearly stated. The draft differentiates between the two platforms in the Platform-Specific Insights section, explaining why Reddit had more detailed feedback.

Actionability of recommendations is strong. Each recommendation includes a specific action, rationale, and timeline where applicable. For example, the Fee Transparency Portal is suggested with a 30-day implementation timeline. The draft also mentions ongoing tasks like monitoring Reddit, which is practical.

I should check if any information in the draft isn't supported by the research summary. The draft mentions "free plan audit via customer service," which isn't in the summary but is a reasonable recommendation based on the billing setup confusion. Since the task allows suggesting improvements while maintaining accuracy, this seems acceptable.

No new facts are introduced beyond the research summary. All examples and data points are from the provided summary. The draft correctly notes the duplicate Reddit posts as a limitation, which is mentioned in the research summary.

Overall, the draft is well-structured, accurate, and meets all the specified requirements. The recommendations are actionable and specific, and the source attributions are correct. The only minor consideration is ensuring that the "free plan audit" is framed as a recommendation rather than an existing feature, which it is. Therefore, the draft is ready for finalization.
