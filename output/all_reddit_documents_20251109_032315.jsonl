Y'all helped me figure out how to rename and modify the SSID and the security level so all my light bulbs, thermostats, Ring devices, TV's, streaming devices, tablets, Phyn, YoLink and laptop would reconnect. All that went smoothly but then I started getting ridiculously low download and upload speeds, like less than 1 Mbps. I chatted with T-Force last week about 8 pm on Twitter to make sure there was no maintenance or congestion in my area. There wasn't.\n\nThe rep wanted me to swap out my new gateway for another one but I had been through that rodeo with my Nokia. I must have swapped out 4 or 5 of them until I found a post on Reddit that recommended sitting the gateway on an electronics fan to cool it. I ordered an electronics fan from Amazon, sat my Nokia on it, and my speed issues disappeared. When I set up the 5G gateway, I tried to sit it on the fan but that wasn't going to work so I put it away. But while chatting with the T-Force rep and learning there was no ongoing maintenance or congestion, I decided to grab the fan and set it up on its side so that it would blow into the (cooling?) holes in the back of the gateway. Voila, my download and upload speeds went back to normal. It seems I was having the same overheating issue with the new gateway as I was having with the old Nokia gateway. I will try to post pictures of my setup so you can see there is no reason why the this gateway (or my Nokia) should overheating.\n\nEDIT: I posted the picture of the 4 bars because my Nokia usually only got 3 bars.

I have 4 lines with 2 of them having Jump On Demand. I have seen that Jump On Demand is ending on Dec. 1st and I want to try to get the most value I can out of this.\n\nThe notice that jod is ending specified that current jod customers are still eligible for one last upgrade. I've checked in-store, and my two options would be base S25 and base iPhone 17. Here's my situation, I am on my last payment on my current jod leases, meaning if I don't do anything by the 7th of November, I keep my current phones and just pay the remaining purchase price. ~$150. But if I do upgrade, I would pay a down payment on a new phone, and then have the remaining loan balance wiped after Dec. 1st per the T-Mobile notice. Essentially walking away with a new phone for around $400. Am I reading this right? There was some confusion between me and the store manager on how to interpret that. He said \" I don't think T mobile is going to be ok with you making one payment and wiping the rest\" so I reached out to T force to confirm and they have.\n\nMy second question of this all is how can i complete my last upgrade, and also keep my current phones? In the past I've been able to do the jod upgrade and take my *old\" phone home, and then the remaining purchase price is added to my next bill which I am 100% ok with. I think they call this a \"deferred payment\" or something but I always have a hard time purchasing the phone at the end because most stores want it back to complete the upgrade, but the phone is almost paid off and I could really use it in one of my other lines.

I'm busy, sorry.\n\nT-Mobile is the one carrier left that accepts any device regardless of IMEI.\n\nWhich normally is a GOOD THING THAT MAKES THEM A LOT OF MONEY.\n\n**Seriously, I have to stop there, and make clear, the other two carriers screwed this up horribly. So many people in the handset and IoT fleet world turned to T-Mobile because:**\n\n**\\* T-Mobile doesn't gatekeep by IMEI.**  \n**\\* T-Mobile doesn't require a useless VoLTE private key.**  \n**\\* T-Mobile doesn't suspend your line for SIM swapping into a device they feel is incompatible.... because, it often $#$!$#! isn't.**\n\nSigh, if you work in Seattle, read all of this in bold clearly. **Do not screw it all up in January.

And devices that can use T-Satellite will/should toast the user to text 911 if on a T-Satellite signal.\n\nThis is the compromise. Network blocks everyone unless they opt-in, and confirm the device is compatible. The eSIM vets the IMEI and confirms the device can use T-Satellite properly. pSIMs with the feature code vet by IMEI. If an incompatible IMEI falls on the account, the T-Satellite SOC falls off.\n\nUnfortunately, this means if you have the grandfathered discounted T-Satellite, you can't move your SIM around, except to w", "flair": "", "author": "", "carrier": "T-Mobile", "awards": 0, "@search.score": 1.0, "@search.reranker_score": null, "@search.highlights": null, "@search.captions": null}

Back in August I traded one of my phones for an iPhone 16 for my daughter's birthday.

Thinking nothing of it I put the phone into the envelope and went to the post office to ship it out. Turns out the package was a UPS shipping envelope, but I dropped it off at USPS. \n\nUnfortunately, at the time I dropped it off it was extremely busy at the post office and I didn't have time to wait around. I left it in the outgoing mail. After about a week I kept getting notices that T Mobile didn't receive my phone. I realized the mistake I had made.\n\nI went to the USPS branch and they assured me that it would still get to where it needed to go, it might just take some extra time. Fast forward 3 months later and T Mobile still has not received it. Unfortunately I did not take down the tracking number, and stupidly enough T Mobile doesn't have the tracking info either.\n\nKnowing it was a long shot, I decided to check with USPS again. They explained that they get a UPS package at least once a day. It gets sent downtown, and the UPS carrier gets it there. Other than that she really couldn't help me, which is understandable.\n\nAll of this to say, if you're doing a trade in, just drop it off at a T Mobile store and make sure you get a receipt that they received it.\n\nOverall it's frustrating, but it was my own stupid mistake that I now must pay for.", "flair": "", "author": "", "carrier": "T-Mobile", "awards": 0, "@search.score": 1.0, "@search.reranker_score": null, "@search.highlights": null, "@search.captions": null}

I've checked in-store, and my two options would be base S25 and base iPhone 17. Here's my situation, I am on my last payment on my current jod leases, meaning if I don't do anything by the 7th of November, I keep my current phones and just pay the remaining purchase price. ~$150. But if I do upgrade, I would pay a down payment on a new phone, and then have the remaining loan balance wiped after Dec. 1st per the T-Mobile notice. Essentially walking away with a new phone for around $400. Am I reading this right? There was some confusion between me and the store manager on how to interpret that. He said \" I don't think T mobile is going to be ok with you making one payment and wiping the rest\" so I reached out to T force to confirm and they have.\n\nMy second question of this all is how can i complete my last upgrade, and also keep my current phones? In the past I've been able to do the jod upgrade and take my *old\" phone home, and then the remaining purchase price is added to my next bill which I am 100% ok with. I think they call this a \"deferred payment\" or something but I always have a hard time purchasing the phone at the end because most stores want it back to complete the upgrade, but the phone is almost paid off and I could really use it in one of my other lines.

So many people in the handset and IoT fleet world turned to T-Mobile because:**\n\n**\\* T-Mobile doesn't gatekeep by IMEI.**  \n**\\* T-Mobile doesn't require a useless VoLTE private key.**  \n**\\* T-Mobile doesn't suspend your line for SIM swapping into a device they feel is incompatible.... because, it often $#$!$#! isn't.**\n\nSigh, if you work in Seattle, read all of this in bold clearly. **Do not screw it all up in January.

And devices that can use T-Satellite will/should toast the user to text 911 if on a T-Satellite signal.\n\nThis is the compromise.

Fast forward 3 months later and T Mobile still has not received it. Unfortunately I did not take down the tracking number, and stupidly enough T Mobile doesn't have the tracking info either.\n\nKnowing it was a long shot, I decided to check with USPS again. They explained that they get a UPS package at least once a day. It gets sent downtown, and the UPS carrier gets it there. Other than that she really couldn't help me, which is understandable.\n\nAll of this to say, if you're doing a trade in, just drop it off at a T Mobile store and make sure you get a receipt that they received it.\n\nOverall it's frustrating, but it was my own stupid mistake that I now must pay for.", "flair": "", "author": "", "carrier": "T-Mobile", "awards": 0, "@search.score": 1.0, "@search.reranker_score": null, "@search.highlights": null, "@search.captions": null}
