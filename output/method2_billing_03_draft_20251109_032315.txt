Okay, I need to write a report based on the provided outline and research summary. Let me start by understanding the structure and the critical rules. The user wants a professional, clear, and actionable tone. I must use only the research summary as the source, follow the outline exactly, and ensure recommendations are specific.

First, the Executive Summary should briefly state the purpose, key findings, and impact. The research summary mentions billing complaints on Reddit but none on Play Store. I need to highlight that.

Next, Data Sources and Methodology. The platforms are Reddit and Play Store. The tools used were API queries with keywords and filters. Limitations include duplicate Reddit posts and no Play Store results. I should explain why Reddit was chosen and note the Play Store's lack of data.

Problem Analysis has three subsections: Unexpected Charges, Billing Setup Confusion, Promotional Confusion. Each needs examples from the research summary. For example, the $15 and $11 charges from Reddit posts. Also, mention the user's quote about "sneaky bastards."

Platform-Specific Insights: Reddit had all the complaints, while Play Store had none. Discuss why users might prefer Reddit for such issues. Also, note the duplicate posts as a data limitation.

Recommendations should be actionable. For Unexpected Charges, suggest a fee transparency portal. For Billing Setup, propose a plan audit tool. For Promotional Confusion, recommend clearer communication during sign-up. Also, suggest monitoring Reddit for feedback.

Implementation Priority: Rank the recommendations. Maybe start with the fee transparency portal as high priority, then the plan audit tool, followed by promotional clarity and monitoring.

Conclusion should summarize the findings and stress the importance of addressing these issues to improve customer satisfaction.

I need to ensure each section flows logically, uses specific examples from the research summary, and cites the platform (Reddit) where applicable. Avoid any markdown and keep the language professional. Check that all points from the outline are covered and that recommendations are specific, like creating a portal or audit tool. Also, mention the lack of Play Store data as a point in the limitations and platform insights.

The primary findings indicate recurring issues with **unexpected charges**, **billing transparency**, and **promotional confusion**, all of which contribute to customer frustration and potential churn.

### **2. Data Sources and Methodology**  
#### **2.1 Platforms Analyzed**  
- **Reddit (r/tmobile subreddit)**:  
  - Chosen for its active user base and history of detailed customer feedback.  
  - Keywords: “billing,” “charges,” “pricing,” “overcharge,” “promo.”  
  - Filters: Negative sentiment (where applicable), recent posts (past 6 months).  
- **Google Play Store**:

- **API Queries**: Automated retrieval of posts and reviews using predefined keywords and filters.  
- **Manual Review**: Analysts verified the relevance and context of retrieved data.  

#### **2.3 Limitations**
